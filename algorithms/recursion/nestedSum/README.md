# Nested Sum

Write a function that accepts an array that only contains two types of things:
numbers and arrays. Those nested arrays also only contain numbers and other
nested arrays.

    Example 1:

    Input: [1, 2, [3]]
    Output: 6

    Example 2:

    Input: [[[2]], 1, [1, 3]]
    Output: 7

Constraints:

    0 <= array.length <= 10^3
