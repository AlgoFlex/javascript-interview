# Factorial

Factorial of a non-negative integer, is multiplication of all positive integers smaller than or equal to n. For example factorial of 6 is 6*5*4*3*2\*1 which is 720.

A factorial is represented by a number and a ” ! ” mark at the end. It is widely used in permutations and combination to calculate the total possible outcomes. A French mathematician Christian Kramp firstly used the exclamation.

    Example 1:

    Input: n = 6
    Output: 720

    Example 2:

    Input: n = 0
    Output: 1

    Example 3:

Input: n = 1
Output: 1

Constraints:

    0 <= n <= 100
